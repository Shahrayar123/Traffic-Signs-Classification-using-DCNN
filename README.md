# Traffic-Signs-Classification-using-CNN

In this project I used 
- Python
- Pickle
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib.pyplot
- Tensorflow

### **Clone dataset from [here](https://bitbucket.org/jadslim/german-traffic-signs/src/master/)**


The dataset contains 
- **34799** training images
- **4410** validation images
- **12630** testing images

Different traffic signs are available in dataset belonging to **43 classes**. In this project I made a model that predict a traffic sign with **94.45%** of testing accuracy

### **Counts of each class in dataset**
